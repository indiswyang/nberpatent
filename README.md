Matching NBER Patent data to Compustat firms, original data source: sites.google.com/site/patentdataproject/


I searched here and didn't find a simple guide to match the patent file and assignee file with GVKEY information using stata, so I provide my own code here. 

The file allows you to identify the patents owned by public companies, with GVKEY information that can be further matched to company's financial data from Compustat up to 2006.

However, I noticed that the matching may not be complete. If you noticed errors in the do file, please don't hesitate sending out issues or pull requests.
